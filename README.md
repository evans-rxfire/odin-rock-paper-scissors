The Odin Project - Foundations Course, Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This is my initial version of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game for the Odin Project. 

In Step 1 of the assignment instructions, it is stated that "The game is played entirely via the console"; then in Step 3 we are told to use the prompt method to get user's input. I was unsure of how to get a prompt in the console, so I used a window prompt. 

Using a for loop in the playGame() funciton seemed to work in getting the playRound() to go 5 times. I added a console.log() at the end of the function to show the final score. 

The instructions weren't specific on how to declare a winner, so I decided to use an alert(). I plan to add a console.log() with the same message as the alert(), but I want to make it styled different so it will stand out in console.
